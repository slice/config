# `nixfiles`

This repository houses [Nix] code that is responsible for managing the
configuration and environment of my personal machines.

Mostly documented for my own sake.

[nix]: https://nixos.org
[home-manager]: https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager
[nix-darwin]: https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin

## Bringup

1. [Install Nix](https://nixos.org/download/):

   ```
   sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install)
   ```

   The installer will describe what it intends to do before prompting you to
   continue. However, in general, it:

   - Creates a new APFS volume for the Nix store.
   - Creates and registers Launch Daemons that mount the volume and spawn the
     Nix daemon.
   - Downloads and unpacks Nix.
   - Creates Nix build users and groups.
   - Writes the necessary shell profiles to make Nix usable.

1. Clone this repository to `~/src/prj/nixfiles`. (As you might guess, this path
   is _also_ hardcoded. For now. Maybe.)

1. Pop open a fresh shell so the computer knows where `nix` lives. Then,
   bootstrap [Home Manager][home-manager] and [nix-darwin]:

   ```
   nix run home-manager/master -- switch --flake ~/src/prj/nixfiles
   nix run nix-darwin -- switch --flake ~/src/prj/nixfiles
   ```

1. Change your shell:

   ```
   sudo chsh -s ~/.nix-profile/bin/fish $USER
   ```

1. You probably have
   [two Nix installations](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin/issues/931) now,
   which needs to be somehow fixed. (Nix is required to bootstrap nix-darwin,
   but nix-darwin essentially functions as a Nix installation in and of itself
   by managing a Nix daemon for you. Furthermore, a nix-darwin module is used to
   version-manage Nix, which will conflict with the Nix binary that was
   previously used to bootstrap this entire setup.)

   - Use `nix doctor` to verify that you don't have conflicting `nix` binaries
     in your `PATH`.
   - Use `launchctl` to ensure that you only have a single Nix daemon (e.g.
     `launchctl print system`, `launchctl disable system/â€¦`, etc.)

1. All done.

## Usage

This repository is a [flake] mostly because it makes pinning dependencies
easier. However, `flake.nix` doesn't do much; in fact, it can largely be boiled
down to:

[flake]: https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes

```nix
outputs = inputs: {
  packages.aarch64-darwin.homeConfigurations.skip = import ./home/bootstrap.nix {
    inherit inputs;
    system = "aarch64-darwin";
    username = "skip";
  };

  packages.x86_64-linux.homeConfigurations.skip = import ./home/bootstrap.nix {
    inherit inputs;
    system = "x86_64-linux";
    username = "skip";
  };

  # ... etc. ...
};
```

To instantiate the `homeManagerConfiguration` outside of a flake context,
[`home/bootstrap.nix`](./home/bootstrap.nix) can be used like so:

```nix
import "${<nixfiles>}/home/bootstrap.nix" {
  system = "aarch64-darwin";
  inputs = {
    inherit nixpkgs home-manager; # etc.
  };
  server = "infer"; # all Macs are workstations
};
```
